About
=====

scikits.learn is a python module for machine learning built on top of
scipy.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeu as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the AUTHORS file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.


Download
========

You can download source code and Windows binaries from SourceForge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/


Dependencies
============

The required dependencies to build the software are python >= 2.5,
NumPy >= 1.1, SciPy, the Boost libraries and a working C++ compiler.

Optional dependencies are scikits.optimization for module
machine.manifold.

To run the tests you will also need nosetests and python-dap
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dap/).


Install
=======

This packages uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
python modules. The install command is::

  python setup.py install
