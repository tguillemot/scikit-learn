About
=====

scikit.learn is a python module for machine learning built on top of
scipy.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeu as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the AUTHORS file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volonteers.


Download
========

There are currently no public releases, please see section 'Code'
below.


Dependencies
===========

To install this package, you will need python >= 2.5, NumPy, the
Boost libraries and a working c++ compiler.

In order to run the tests, you will need nosetests, python-dap
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dap/) and sikits.optimization.


Install
=======

This packages uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
python modules. The install command is::

  python setup.py install

If you have installed the boost libraries in a non-standard location
you might need to pass the appropriate --include argument so that it
find the correct headers. For example, if your headers reside in
/opt/local/include, (which is the case if you have installed them
through Mac Ports), you must issue the commands::

  python setup.py build_ext --include=/opt/local/include
  python setup.py install
