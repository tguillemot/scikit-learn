About
=====

scikit.learn is a python module for machine learning built on top of
scipy.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeu as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the AUTHORS file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by Fabian Pedregosa.


Download
========

There are currently no public releases, please se the section 'Code'
below.


Dependencies
===========

To install this package, you will need python >= 2.5, NumPy, the
Boost libraries and a working c++ compiler.

In order to run the tests, you will need nosetests, python-dap
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dap/) and sikits.optimization.


Install
=======

This packages uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
python modules. To install, type in the command prompt (you might need
superuser privileges)

  python setup.py install

If you have installed the boost libraries in a non-standard location
you might need to pass the appropriate --include argument so that it
find the correct headers. For example, if your headers reside in
/opt/local/include, (which is the case if you have installed them
through Mac Ports), you must issue the command:

  python setup.py build_ext --include=/opt/local/include
  python setup.py install
