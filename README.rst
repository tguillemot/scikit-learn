About
=====

``scikit-learn`` is a python module for machine learning built on
top of numpy / scipy.

The purpose of the ``scikit-learn-tutorial`` subproject is to learn
how to apply machine learning to practical situations using the
algorithms implemented in the ``scikit-learn`` library.

The target audience is experienced Python developers familiar with
numpy and scipy.


Downloading the PDF

Building the tutorial
=====================

You can build the HTML and PDF (requires pdflatex) versions of this
tutorial by installing sphinx (1.0.0+)::

  $ sudo pip install -U sphinx

Then for the html variant::

  $ cd tutorial
  $ make html

The results is available in the ``_build/html/`` subdolder. Point your browser
to the ``index.html`` file for table of content.

To build the PDF variant::

  $ make latex
  $ cd _build/latex
  $ pdflatex scikit_learn_tutorial.tex

You should get a file named ``scikit_learn_tutorial.pdf`` as output.


Testing
=======

The example snippets in the rST source files can be tested with `nose`_::

  $ nosetests -s --with-doctest --doctest-tests --doctest-extension=rst

Contact the developers
======================

If you have questions about this tutorial you can ask them on the
``scikit-learn`` mailing list on sourceforge:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scikit-learn-general

Some developers tend to hang around the channel ``#scikit-learn``
at ``irc.freenode.net``, especially during the week preparing a new
release. If nobody is available to answer your questions there don't
hesitate to ask it on the mailing list to reach a wider audience.
