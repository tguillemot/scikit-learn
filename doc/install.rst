Installing `scikits.learn`
===============================

There are different ways to get scikits.learn installed:

  * Install the version of scikits.learn provided by your
    :ref:`operating system distribution <install_by_distribution>` . This
    is the quickest option for those who have operating systems that
    distribute scikits.learn.

  * :ref:`Install an official release <install_official_release>`. This
    is the best approach for users who want a stable version number
    and aren't concerned about running a slightly older version of
    scikits.learn.

  * :ref:`Install the latest development version
    <install_bleeding_edge>`.  This is best for users who want the
    latest-and-greatest features and aren't afraid of running
    brand-new code.
