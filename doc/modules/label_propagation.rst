Label Propagation
===================================================

`scikits.learn.label_propagation` contains a few variations of semi-supervised, 
graph inference algorithms. In the semi-supervised classification setting, the 
learning algorithm is fed both labeled and unlabeled data. With the addition of
unlabeled data in the training model, the algorithm can better learn the total 
structure of the data. These algorithms generally do very well in practice even
when faced with far fewer labeled points than ordinary classification models.

A few features available in this model:
  * Can be used for classification and regression tasks
  * Kernel methods to project data into alternate dimensional spaces

.. topic:: Input labels for semi-supervised learning
    It is important to assign an identifier to unlabeled points along with the
    labeled data when training the model with the `fit` method. 

This module provides two label propagation models: :class:`LabelPropagation` and
:class:`LabelSpreading`. Both work by forming a fully connected graph for each
item in the input dataset. They differ only in the definition of the matrix 
that represents the graph and the clamp effect on the label distributions.
:class:`LabelPropagation` is far more intuitive than :class:`LabelSpreading`
which is motivatived by deeper mathematics.

Clamping
========
Clamping allows the algorithm to change the weight of the true ground labeled 
data to some degree. The :class:`LabelPropagation` algorithm performs hard 
clamping of input labels, which means :math:`\alpha=1`. This clamping factor 
can be relaxed, to say :math:`\alpha=0.8`, which means that we will always 
retain 80 percent of our original label distribution, but the algorithm gets to
change it's confidence of the distribution within 20 percent.
