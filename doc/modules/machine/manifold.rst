k-Nearest Neighbor
==================

the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a method for classifying
objects based on closest training examples in the feature space. k-NN
is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the
function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred
until classification. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is amongst the
simplest of all machine learning algorithms: an object is classified
by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to
the class most common amongst its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive
integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply
assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor.
