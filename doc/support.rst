There are several ways to get in touch with the developers

Mailing List
============

Main mailing list is `scikit-learn-general
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scikit-learn-general>`_. There
is also a commit list, where updates to the main repo get notified: `scikit-learn-commits <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scikit-learn-commits>`_



Bug tracker
===========

If you think you've encoutered a bug, please report it to the issue tracker:

IRC
===
Some devs like to hang out on channel #learn on irc.freenode.net

If you do not have an irc client or are behind a firewall this web
client works fine: http://webchat.freenode.net
