.. title Scikit-learn for efficient and easier machine learning research
.. Author: Gaël Varoquaux


At INRIA, we use scikit-learn to support leading-edge basic research in many
teams: `Parietal <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/>`_ for neuroimaging, `Lear
<http://lear.inrialpes.fr/>`_ for computer vision, `Visages
<https://www.irisa.fr/visages/index>`_ for medical image analysis, `Privatics
<https://team.inria.fr/privatics>`_ for security. The project is a fantastic
tool to address difficult applications of machine learing in an academic
environment as it is performant and versatile, but all easy-to-use and well
documented, which makes it well suited to grad students.

Building a classifier is typically an iterative process of exploring
the data, selecting the features (the attributes of the data believed
to be predictive in some way), training the models, and finally
evaluating them. For many of these tasks, we relied on the excellent
scikit-learn package for Python. Currently, we use a variant of Naive
Bayes classification to do our prediction. We picked Naive Bayes
because it’s simple, fast, and performs quite well on this kind of
classification problem despite a few limitations arising from its
simplicity.

At Telecom ParisTech, scikit-learn is used for hands on sessions and home
assignments in introductory and advanced machine learning courses. The classes
are for undergrads and masters students. The great benefit of scikit-learn is
its fast learning curve that allows students to quickly start working on
interesting and motivating problems.
