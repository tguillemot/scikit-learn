Supervised learning: predicting an output variable from high-dimensional observations
=======================================================================================


.. topic:: The problem solved in supervised learning

   Supervised learning consists in learning the link between two
   datasets: the observed data `X`, and an external variable `y` that we
   are trying to predict, usually called `target` or `labels`. Most often, 
   `y` is a 1D array of length `n_samples`. 
   
   All supervised estimators in the `scikit-learn` implement a `fit(X, y)`
   method to fit the model, and a `predict(X)` method that, given
   unlabeled observations `X`, returns predicts the corresponding labels
   `y`.

.. topic:: Vocabulary: classification and regression

   If the prediction task is to classify the observations in a set of
   finite labels, in other words to "name" the objects observed, the task
   is said to be a **classification** task. On the opposite, if the goal
   is to predict a continous target variable, it is said to be a
   **regression** task.

   In the `scikit-learn`, for classification tasks, `y` is a vector of
   integers.

Nearest neighbor and the curse of dimensionality
=================================================

.. topic:: Classifying irises:

    The iris dataset is a classification task consisting in identifying 3
    different types of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) from
    their petal and sepal length and width::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scikits.learn import datasets
        >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
        >>> iris_X = iris.data
        >>> iris_y = iris.target
        >>> np.unique(iris_y)
        array([0, 1, 2])

k-Nearest neigbhors classifier
-------------------------------

The simplest possible classifier is the nearest neighbor: given a new
observation `x_test`, find in the training set (i.e. the data used to train
the estimator) the observation with the closest feature vector.

.. topic:: Training set and testing set

   When experimenting with learning algorithm, it is important not to
   test the prediction of an estimator on the data used to fit the
   estimator, as this would not be evaluating the performance of the
   estimator on **new data**. This is why datasets are often split into
   *train* and *test* data.

**KNN (k nearest neighbors) classification example**:

.. image:: ../examples/iris_knn.png
   :scale: 90

::

    >>> # Split iris data in train and test data
    >>> # A random permutation, to split the data randomly
    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> indices = np.random.permutation(len(iris_X))
    >>> iris_X_train = iris_X[indices[:-10]]
    >>> iris_y_train = iris_y[indices[:-10]]
    >>> iris_X_test  = iris_X[indices[-10:]]
    >>> iris_y_test  = iris_y[indices[-10:]]
    >>> # Create and fit a nearest-neighbor classifier
    >>> from scikits.learn.neighbors import NeighborsClassifier
    >>> knn = NeighborsClassifier()
    >>> knn.fit(iris_X_train, iris_y_train)
    NeighborsClassifier(algorithm='auto', classification_type='knn_vote',
              leaf_size=30, n_neighbors=5, radius=1.0)
    >>> knn.predict(iris_X_test)
    array([1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0])
    >>> iris_y_test
    array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0])

The curse of dimensionality
-------------------------------

If the data is only described by one feature, with values ranging from 0
to 1, with `n` train observations, new data will no further away than
`1/n` and the nearest neighbor decision rule will be efficient as soon as
`1/n` is small compared to the scale of between-class feature variations.

If the number of features is `p`, the number of training samples to pave
the `[0, 1]` space with a between-point distance of `d`, is `1/d**p`.
This number scales exponentialy `p`, the dimensionality of the problem.

In other words, the prediction problem becomes much harder for
high-dimensional data. This is called the **curse of dimensionality** and
is the core problem that machine learning addresses.

Linear model: from regression to sparsity
==========================================

.. topic:: Diabetes dataset

    The diabetes dataset consists of 10 physiological variables (age,
    sex, weight, blood pressure) measure on 442 patients, and an
    indication of disease progression after one year::

        >>> diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
        >>> diabetes_X_train = diabetes.data[:-20]
        >>> diabetes_X_test  = diabetes.data[-20:]
        >>> diabetes_y_train = diabetes.target[:-20]
        >>> diabetes_y_test  = diabetes.target[-20:]
    
    The task at hand is to predict disease prediction from physiological
    variables.

    >>> # Explained variance score: 1 is perfect prediction
    >>> regr.score(diabetes_X_test, diabetes_y_test)
    0.58507530226905713


Shrinkage 
----------

If there are few data points per dimension, noise in the observations
induces high variance:

.. image:: auto_examples/images/plot_ols_variance_1.png
   :scale: 70
   :align: right

::

    >>> X = np.c_[ .5, 1].T
    >>> y = [.5, 1]
    >>> test = np.c_[ 0, 2].T
    >>> regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
    
    >>> import pylab as pl
    >>> pl.figure() # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> for _ in range(6): # doctest: +SKIP
    ...    this_X = .1*np.random.normal(size=(2, 1)) + X
    ...    regr.fit(X, y)
    ...    pl.plot(test, regr.predict(test))
    ...    pl.scatter(this_X, y, s=3) 



A solution, in high-dimensional statistical learning, is to *srhink* the
regression coefficients to zero: any two randomly chosen set of
observations are likely to be uncorrelated. This is called *ridge*
regression:

.. image:: auto_examples/images/plot_ridge_variance_1.png 
   :scale: 70
   :align: right

::

    >>> regr = linear_model.Ridge(alpha=.1)

    >>> pl.figure() # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> for _ in range(6): # doctest: +SKIP
    ...    this_X = .1*np.random.normal(size=(2, 1)) + X
    ...    regr.fit(this_X, y)
    ...    pl.plot(test, regr.predict(test))
    ...    pl.scatter(this_X, y, s=3)

This is an example of **bias/variance tradeoff**: the larger the ridge
`alpha` parameter, the higher the bias and the lower the variance.

We can choose `alpha` to minimize left out error, this time using the
diabetes dataset, rather than our synthetic data:: 

    >>> alphas = np.logspace(-4, -1, 6)
    >>> print [regr._set_params(alpha=alpha
    ...             ).fit(diabetes_X_train, diabetes_y_train,
    ...             ).score(diabetes_X_test, diabetes_y_test) for alpha in alphas]
    [0.58511106838835292, 0.58520730154446743, 0.58546775406984897, 0.58555120365039137, 0.58307170855541623, 0.570589994372801]


.. note::

    Capturing in the fitted parameters noise that prevents the model to
    generalize to new data is called **overfitting**. The bias introduced
    by the ridge regression is called a **regularization**.

    |diabetes_ols_diag| |diabetes_ols_x2| |diabetes_ols_x1| 

.. note::

   A representation of the full diabetes dataset would involve 11
   dimensions (10 feature dimensions, and one of the target variable). It
   is hard to develop an intuition on such representation, but it may be
   useful to keep in mind that it would be a fairly *empty* space.



We can see that although feature 2 has a strong coefficient on the full
model, it conveys little information on `y` when considered with feature
1.

To improve the conditioning of the problem (mitigate the curse of
dimensionality), it would be interesting to select only the informative
features and set non-informative ones, like feature 2 to 0. Ridge regression
will decrease their contribution, but not set them to zero. Another
penalization approach, called **Lasso**, can set some coefficients to zero.
Such methods are called **sparse method**, and sparsity can be seen as an
application of Occam's razor: prefer simpler models.

.. topic:: **Different algorithms for a same problem**

    Different algorithms can be used to solve the same mathematical
    problem. For instance the `Lasso` object in the `scikit-learn`
    solves the lasso regression using a *coordinate descent* method, that
    is efficient on large datasets. However, the `scikit-learn` also
    provides the `LassoLARS` object, using the *LARS* which is very
    efficient for problems in which the weight vector estimated is very
    sparse, that is problems with very few observations.

Classification
---------------

.. image:: ../examples/logistic_regression.png
   :scale: 65
   :align: right

For classification, as in the labeling iris task, linear regression is
not the right approach, as it will give too much weight to data far from
the decision frontier. A linear approach is to fit a sigmoid function, or
**logistic** function:

.. math::

   y = \textrm{sigmoid}(X\beta - \textrm{offset}) + \epsilon =
   \frac{1}{1 + \textrm{exp}(- X\beta + \textrm{offset})} + \epsilon

::

    >>> logistic = linear_model.LogisticRegression(C=1e5)
    >>> logistic.fit(iris_X_train, iris_y_train)
    LogisticRegression(C=100000.0, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
              intercept_scaling=1, penalty='l2', tol=0.0001)

.. image:: ../examples/iris_logistic.png
   :scale: 83

.. topic:: Multiclass classification

   If you have several classes to predict, an option often used is to fit
   one-versus-all classifiers, and use a voting heuristic for the final
   decision.

.. topic:: Shrinkage and sparsity with logistic regression

   The `C` parameter controls the amount of regularization in the
   `LogisticRegression` object, the bigger `C`, the less regularization.
   `penalty="l2"` gives shrinkage (i.e. non-sparse coefficients), while 
   `penalty="l1"` gives sparsity.

Support vector machines (SVMs)
================================

Linear SVMs
-------------

SVMs are a discrimant model: they try to find a combination of samples to
build a plane maximizing the margin between the two classes.
Regularization is set by the `C` parameter: with small `C` give
(regularized problem) the margin is computed only on the observation
close to the separating plane; with large `C` all the observations are
used.

SVMs can be used in regression --SVR (Support Vector Regression)--, or in
classification --SVC (Support Vector Classification). 

::

    >>> from scikits.learn import svm
    >>> svc = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
    >>> svc.fit(iris_X_train, iris_y_train)
    SVC(C=1.0, cache_size=200, coef0=0.0, degree=3, gamma=0.0, kernel='linear',
      probability=False, shrinking=True, tol=0.001)


.. warning:: **Normalizing data**

   For many estimators, including the SVMs, having datasets with unit
   standard deviation for each feature is important to get good
   prediction.

Using kernels
--------------

Classes are not always separable in feature space. The solution is to
build a decision function that is not linear but that may be for instance
polynomial. This is done using the *kernel trick* that can be seen as
creating an decision energy by positioning *kernels* on observations:
