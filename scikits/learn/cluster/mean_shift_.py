    Parameters
    ----------

    bandwidth: float, optional
        Bandwith used in the RBF kernel
        If not set, the bandwidth is estimated.
        See clustering.estimate_bandwidth

    seeds: array [n_samples, n_features], optional
        Seeds used to initialize kernels. If not set,
        the seeds are calculated by clustering.get_bucket_seeds
        with bandwidth as the grid size and default values for
        other parameters.

    cluster_all: boolean, default True
        If true, then all points are clustered, even those orphans that are
        not within any kernel. Orphans are assigned to the nearest kernel.
        If false, then orphans are given cluster label -1.

    feature space analysis". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
    Machine Intelligence. 2002. pp. 603-619.

    Scalability:
    
    In general, the algorithmic complexity of the mean shift algorithm
    is O(T n^2) with n the number of samples and T the number of
    points.

    Because this implementation uses a flat kernel and
    a KD-Tree to look up members of each kernel, the complexity will tend
    to O(T n*log(n)). In higher dimensions,  finding nearest neighbors
    using the KD-Tree may become more expensive.

    Scalability can be boosted by using fewer seeds, for examply by using
    a higher value of min_bin_freq in the get_bucket_seeds function.

    Note that the estimate_bandwidth function is much less scalable than
    the mean shift algorithm and will be the bottleneck if it is used.
