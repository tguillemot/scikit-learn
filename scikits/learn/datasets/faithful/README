Each OldfaithfulC*.txt is one column of the datasets as presented in Azzalini
and Bowman. The Oldfaithful.txt is simply a cat of all thos files: this is just
to make checking easier. The data in the txt are *exactly* the same than the
ones in Azzalini and Bowman: again, post processing them in python is easy
(converting the time in seconds, etc...), and having exactly the data of the
reference makes it easier to check.
