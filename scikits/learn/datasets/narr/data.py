DESCRSHORT  = """NCEP NARR data sets"""

DESCRLONG   = """The NARR is a reanalysis of
historical observations using a 32 km version of the NCEP 1993
operational ETA model and ETA data assimilation system (EDAS).
The domain of analyses includes North and Central America as
well as small parts of the UK, Eastern Asia and South America
and the oceans in between. The period of the reanalyses is from
October 1978 to the present and analyses were made 8 times
daily. Horizontal boundary conditions were derived from the
NCEP/DOE Reanalysis.
The "merged" dataset provides a high spatial (32 km) and
temporal (3 hour) analyses of North America and adjacent oceans
and land masses from October 1978 to the present. Advantages
over the widely used NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis are its higher
resolution and a much better treatment of the land surface
through a better land-surface model (NOAH), through the
assimilation of more surface data (observed precipitation and
surface winds) and through a better representation of the
terrain (heights, vegetation, soil type).
This data set contains "conventional" atmospheric analyses as
well as model-derived fields which contain estimates of
subsurface, surface, and radiative properties.

    through Data Access Protocol (DAP) from a remote server. The returned 
    object is not the entire data set, but only the metadata describing the 
    data set content. Individual variables are properties of the object, and
    are downloaded only on explicit request (see example below).  
    
    Parameters:
        year : int
        month : int

    Note:
    The data is available starting on 1979-01-01 and up to the the month before
    last. Each dataset contains around 190 different variables at 3h intervals.

        mslet: Mean sea level pressure (eta model) [pa].
        tmpsfc : Surface temperature [K].
        dswrfsfc : Surface downward shortwave radiation flux [W/m^2].
