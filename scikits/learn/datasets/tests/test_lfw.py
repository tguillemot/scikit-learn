"""This test for the LFW require medium-size data dowloading and processing

If the data has not been already downloaded by runnning the examples,
the tests won't run (skipped).

If the test are run, the first execution will be long (typically a bit
more than a couple of minutes) but as the dataset loader is leveraging
joblib, successive runs will be fast (less than 200ms).
