    """Compute the homogeneity and completeness and V-measure scores at once

    Those metrics are based on normalized conditional entropy measures of
    the clustering labeling to evaluate given the knowledge of a Ground
    Truth class labels of the same samples.

    A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters
    contain only data points which are members of a single class.

    A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points
    that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster.

    Both scores have positive values between 0.0 and 1.0, larger values
    being desirable.

    Those 3 metrics are symmetric in the sense that a permutation of
    the class or cluster label values won't change the score values in
    any way.

    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]

    Returns
    -------
    homogeneity: float

    completeness: float
       score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly complete labeling

    Examples
    --------

    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have score 1.0::

      >>> v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters
    are complete be not homogeneous, hence penalized::

      >>> v_measure_score([0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 1, 1])     # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.66...

    Labelings that have pure clusters with members comming from the same
    classes are homogeneous but un-necessary splitts harms completeness
    and thus penalize V-measure as well::

      >>> v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2])     # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.8...
      >>> v_measure_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3])     # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      0.66...

    If classes members are completly splitted accross different clusters,
    the assignment is totally in-complete, hence the v-measure is null::

      >>> v_measure_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      0.0

    Clusters that include samples from totally different classes totally
    destroy the homogeneity of the labeling, hence::

      0.0
