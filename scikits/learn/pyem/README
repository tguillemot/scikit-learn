pyem is a python module build upon numpy and scipy
(see http://www.scipy.org/) for learning mixtures models
using Expectation Maximization. For now, only Gaussian
Mixture Models are implemented. Included features:
    - computation of Gaussian pdf for multi-variate Gaussian
    random vectors (spherical, diagonal and full covariance matrices)
    - Sampling of Gaussian Mixtures Models
    - Confidence ellipsoides with probability 0.5
    - Classic EM for Gaussian Mixture Models
    - K-mean based initialization
