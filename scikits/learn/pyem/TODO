Things which must be implemented for a 1.0 version (in importante order)
    - A class for learning + a classifier
    - test for various length and model size of gaussian densities/GM and GMM
    - a small help/tutorial
    - be complient with scipy module dev guidelines (DEVELOPERS.TXT)

Things which would be nice (after 1.0 version):
    - Integrate libem (libem should be modified so
    that it would be easy to package and distribute)
    - Other initialization schemes
    - Other mixture models
