Things which must be implemented for a 1.0 version (in importante order)
    - A classifier
    - basic regularization
    - Use scipy.cluster kmeans instead of our own, as it now provides all
    necessary functionalities.

Things which would be nice (after 1.0 version):
    - Bayes prior (hard, suppose MCMC)
    - variational Bayes (hard ? Not sure yet)
    - Integrate libem (libem should be modified so
    that it would be easy to package and distribute)
    - Other initialization schemes
    - Other mixture models
