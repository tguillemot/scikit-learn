Things which must be implemented for a 1.0 version (in importante order)
    - test for various length and model size 
    - a small help/tutorial
    - be complient with scipy module dev guidelines (DEVELOPERS.TXT)
    - On-line EM
    - use scipy.cluster.vq instead of custom kmeans algo (find
    a way to get label from vq.kmeans: depends on scipy changes)
    - C implementation of Gaussian densities at least (partially done,
    but need integration into distutils + portable way of detecting/
    loading shared library with ctypes)
    - numpy computations make huge difference between C and F storage: 
    should review the code to see if the

Things which would be nice:
    - Integrate libem (libem should be modified so
    that it would be easy to package and distribute)
    - Other initialization schemes
    - Other mixture models
