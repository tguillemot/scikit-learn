Things which must be implemented for a 1.0 version:
    - test for various length and model size.
    - a small help/tutorial

Things which would be nice:
    - C implementation of Gaussian densities at least.
    - Integrate libem (libem should be modified so
    that it would be easy to package and distribute)
    - On-line EM
    - Other initialization schemes
    - Other mixture models
