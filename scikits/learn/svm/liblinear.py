class LinearSVC(BaseLibLinear, ClassifierMixin):
    """Linear Support Vector Classification.

    Similar to SVC with parameter kernel='linear', but uses internally
    liblinear rather than libsvm, so it has more flexibility in the
    choice of penalties and loss functions and should be faster for
    huge datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : string, 'l1' or 'l2' (default 'l2')
        Specifies the loss function. With 'l1' it is the standard SVM
        loss (a.k.a. hinge Loss) while with 'l2' it is the squared loss.
        (a.k.a. squared hinge Loss)

    penalty : string, 'l1' or 'l2' (default 'l2')
        Specifies the norm used in the penalization. The 'l2'
        penalty is the standard used in SVC. The 'l1' leads to coef_
        vectors that are sparse.

    dual : bool, (default True)
        Select the algorithm to either solve the dual or primal
        optimization problem.

    eps: float, optional
         precision for stopping criteria

    multi_class: boolean, optional
         perform multi-class SVM by Cramer and Singer. If active,
         options loss, penalty and dual will be ignored.

    intercept_scaling : float, default: 1
        when self.fit_intercept is True, instance vector x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equals to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes intercept_scaling * synthetic feature weight
        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased

    Attributes
    ----------
    `coef_` : array, shape = [n_features] if n_classes == 2 else [n_classes, n_features]
        Weights asigned to the features (coefficients in the primal
        problem). This is only available in the case of linear kernel.

    `intercept_` : array, shape = [1] if n_classes == 2 else [n_classes]
        Constants in decision function.

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
    select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
    to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
    that happens, try with a smaller eps parameter.
