    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like or CSR matrix.
        The data to center and scale.

    axis : int (0 by default)
        axis used to compute the means and standard deviations along. If 0,
        independently standardize each feature, otherwise (if 1) standardize
        each sample.

    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.

    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSR matrix and if axis is 1).

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.

    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_mean=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSR matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.

    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSR matrix.

class StandardScaler(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):

    Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing
    the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
    standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using the
    `transform` method.

    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
    individual feature do not more or less look like standard normally
    distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

    For instance many elements used in the objective function of
    a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
    Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
    all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
    order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
    that others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
    estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.
        This does not work (and will raise an exception) when attempted on
        sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
        matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
        memory.

    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
        This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
        not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
        returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mean_ : array of floats with shape [n_features]
        The mean value for each feature in the training set.

    std_ : array of floats with shape [n_features]

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.

    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_centering=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSR matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.

    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSR matrix.

class OneHotEncoder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Encode categorical integer features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme.

    The input to this transformer should be a matrix of integers, denoting
    the values taken on by categorical (discrete) features. The output will be
    a sparse matrix where each column corresponds to one possible value of one
    feature. It is assumed that input features take on values in the range
    [0, n_values).

    This encoding is needed for feeding categorical data to many scikit-learn
    estimators, notably linear models and SVMs with the standard kernels.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_categorical_features>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_values : 'auto', int or array of ints
        Number of values per feature.

        - 'auto' : determine value range from training data.
        - int : maximum value for all features.
        - array : maximum value per feature.

    categorical_features: "all" or array of indices or mask
        Specify what features are treated as categorical.

        - 'all' (default): All features are treated as categorical.
        - array of indices: Array of categorical feature indices.
        - mask: Array of length n_features and with dtype=bool.

        Non-categorical features are always stacked to the right of the matrix.

    dtype : number type, default=np.float
        Desired dtype of output.

    sparse : boolean, default=True
        Will return sparse matrix if set True else will return an array.

    handle_unknown : str, 'error' or 'ignore'
        Whether to raise an error or ignore if a unknown categorical feature is
        present during transform.

    Attributes
    ----------
    active_features_ : array
        Indices for active features, meaning values that actually occur
        in the training set. Only available when n_values is ``'auto'``.

    feature_indices_ : array of shape (n_features,)
        Indices to feature ranges.
        Feature ``i`` in the original data is mapped to features
        from ``feature_indices_[i]`` to ``feature_indices_[i+1]``
        (and then potentially masked by `active_features_` afterwards)

    n_values_ : array of shape (n_features,)
        Maximum number of values per feature.

    Examples
    --------
    Given a dataset with three features and two samples, we let the encoder
    find the maximum value per feature and transform the data to a binary
    one-hot encoding.

    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
    >>> enc = OneHotEncoder()
    >>> enc.fit([[0, 0, 3], [1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 1], \
[1, 0, 2]])  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    OneHotEncoder(categorical_features='all', dtype=<... 'float'>,
           handle_unknown='error', n_values='auto', sparse=True)
    >>> enc.n_values_
    array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> enc.feature_indices_
    array([0, 2, 5, 9])
    >>> enc.transform([[0, 1, 1]]).toarray()
    array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.]])
